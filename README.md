# CppND-Project-SystemMonitor

This repository contains the result of the second project of the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The project concerns a system monitor for the Linux Operating System and emphasized learnings from the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course of the program.

# CppND-System-Monitor Starter Code

In order to get a flying start, Udacity provided with starter code that can be found at: https://github.com/udacity/CppND-System-Monitor-Project-Updated.git.
So in case your intent is to try out this project yourself, have a look at Udacity's own website and or starter code repository. Otherwise, feel free to continue reading and try out my solution.

## Instructions

1. First, make sure you have installed [ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/), which is a library that facilitates text-based graphical output in the terminal. This project relies on ncurses for display output.

You can install ncurses within your own Linux environment: `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

2. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/udacity/CppND-System-Monitor-Project-Updated.git`

3. Build the project: `make build`

4. Run the resulting executable: `./build/monitor`
